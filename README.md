## Lab 06

Today we started the Salmon Cookies project. We were introduced to DOM events and all the complicated things that seem to come with that. I'm able to replicate what I saw in the demo and get my page similarly functional but I don't quite understand it. I'm feeling pretty fatigued mentally, but I'm confident this will all start making more sense soon. I was feeling pretty dang confident coming into today and I'm going to try to bring that with me tomorrow, too.
 
## Lab 07

This lab took me two days to finally get right but it felt good when I did. I spent a lot of time writing and re writing the DOM manipulation code until I finally asked for help. I was really close and only had to change a few things. Getting TA help aided me in getting comfortable with the DOM manipulation process and once I went through it a few times it started becoming concrete knowledge. I got help one more time when trying to make the header. That one was a mistake on not re-reading the instructions because it was clearly printed to place the header outside of the protoype render function. Next time I'm stumped I'll make sure to re-read the instructions. 

## Lab 08

This was the fun part of the lab! For the most part I think I got all of the requirements done except for the grand total, which I will complete tomorrow. I'm cutting it close with the time. I worked on it for at least 5 hours after catching up on lab 07. I really enjoyed learning the css and figuring out how to select the things I wanted. I inspected quite a few other random web pages to see how other folks are styling things and how they structure their html. It was very helpful. Overall this lab went well I think and I'm excited for the next part. 

## Lab 09

This one was fun for me because we were finally able to get our application to do human things. Creating the form in html was a long process, but I can see how it will be easier with practice. I started out with pen and paper to understand the logic and went from there. Getting the event handler function to work was a fun process. It didn't seem like we were doing anything new besides targeting the events. I used the event to create a new location and then pushed that location the stores array. It was so satisfying changing bits of code and getting the form to function a little more each time. I don't think the grand totals are due yet, but I put my best effort into that. I think I'm really close. I was able to create the nested loop with the 2d array and render the row to the table, but each of the cells come back as NaN. It's strange because I'm able to acess the number with console logs. I think I may have misnamed a variable somewhere. I'll figure it out tomorrow!

## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.
