## Lab 06

Today we started the Salmon Cookies project. We were introduced to DOM events and all the complicated things that seem to come with that. I'm able to replicate what I saw in the demo and get my page similarly functional but I don't quite understand it. I'm feeling pretty fatigued mentally, but I'm confident this will all start making more sense soon. I was feeling pretty dang confident coming into today and I'm going to try to bring that with me tomorrow, too.
 
## Lab 07

This lab took me two days to finally get right but it felt good when I did. I spent a lot of time writing and re writing the DOM manipulation code until I finally asked for help. I was really close and only had to change a few things. Getting TA help aided me in getting comfortable with the DOM manipulation process and once I went through it a few times it started becoming concrete knowledge. I got help one more time when trying to make the header. That one was a mistake on not re-reading the instructions because it was clearly printed to place the header outside of the protoype render function. Next time I'm stumped I'll make sure to re-read the instructions.
