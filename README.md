 Application and website for a mock cookie stand to showcase javascript skills

## Lab 06

Today we started the Salmon Cookies project. We were introduced to DOM events and all the complicated things that seem to come with that. I'm able to replicate what I saw in the demo and get my page similarly functional but I don't quite understand it. I'm feeling pretty fatigued mentally, but I'm confident this will all start making more sense soon. I was feeling pretty dang confident coming into today and I'm going to try to bring that with me tomorrow, too.
